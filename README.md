# GalleryApp

This is an application that mocks Androids preloaded Gallery App onto their devices. In order for the images to display you will need to drag and drop the images from your local machine onto the virtual emulator. Once you do this an sdcard directory will be generated and Shared Stored Media Queries will retrieve the images from the respective directories.
